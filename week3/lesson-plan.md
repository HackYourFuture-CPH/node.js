# Lesson plan

```
> Focus on having lots of in class exercises.

> DONT teach everything, let the students investigate topics on their own aswell!

> Focus on how to read documentation, google answers and google errors!!

> Teach towards the students being able to solve the homework
```

Remember to add the code you wrote in the class to the relevant class branch's class work folder. If the branch has not been created just create and push it :) If you dont have access, write to one from the core team. You can see an example below!

To find examples of what teachers have taught before go to the class branches in the classwork folder, Fx [class 07](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/JavaScript/tree/class07/JavaScript1/Week1/classwork)

If you find anything that could be improved then please create a pull request! We welcome changes, so please get involved if you have any ideas!!!

- Database interaction - No ORM!
  - Connecting to mysql
    - [Using connection](#Mysql-connection)
    - In homework [pools](homework/src/server/database.js) are used, but dont explain this
    - Environment variables. Check [this repo](homework/README.md#environment-variables)
  - Executing queries
    - Simple
    - Placeholder values `'SELECT * FROM books WHERE author = ?', ['David']`
  - [Code inspiration](#phonebook-database)
  - [Exercise](#connecting-the-database)
- API
  - REST
  - CRUD (follow the structure found in [the homework template](./homework/src/server) )
    - Router verb `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `PUT`
      - Especially focus on post with `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));` and `app.use(express.json());`
  - [Code inspiration](#phonebook-api)
- Postman
  - `POST`, `DELETE`, `PUT` requests

## Code inspiration

### Mysql connection
```js
var mysql = require('mysql');
var settings = require('./settings.json');
var db;

function connectDatabase() {
    if (!db) {
        db = mysql.createConnection(settings);

        db.connect(function(err){
            if(!err) {
                console.log('Database is connected!');
            } else {
                console.log('Error connecting database!');
            }
        });
    }
    return db;
}

module.exports = connectDatabase();`
```

```js
var db = require('./database');

db.query('SELECT ? FROM t_user',query, function(err, results, query) {
    if (err) throw err;
    if(!err) {
        indexPage.receiveResults(results);
    }
});
```

### Phonebook database
Create a phonebook database with contacts:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `phonebook`.`contacts` (
  `idcontacts` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `phonenumber` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`idcontacts`));
```

```js
var db = require('./database');

db.query('SELECT * FROM `contacts` WHERE `id` = ?', [1], function(err, results, query) {
    if (err) throw err;
    if(!err) {
        console.log(results);
    }
});

const contact = {
    name: 'benjamin',
    phonenumber: '12345678',
}
db.query('INSERT INTO posts SET ?', contact, function(err, results, query) {
    if (err) throw err;
    if(!err) {
        console.log(results);
    }
});

```

### Phonebook api
Create the following api

| Url | Verb | Functionality | Example | 
| ---- | ----- | ---- | -------- |
| `api/contacts/` | GET | Returns all contacts | `GET api/contacts/` |
| `api/contacts/` | POST | Adds a new contact | `POST api/contacts/` |
| `api/contacts/{id}` | GET | Returns contact by `id` | `GET api/contacts/2` |
| `api/contacts/{id}` | PUT | Updates the contact by `id` | `PUT api/contacts/2` |
| `api/contacts/{id}` | DELETE | Deletes the contact by `id` | `DELETE contacts/2` |

## Exercises

### Concerts api

Lets create an api for concerts

#### Connecting the database
Create a `concerts` table in mysql. It should have these columns: `title`, `band`, `venue`, `createdDate`, `performanceDate` and `price`

Using node and the `mysql` lib:
- `INSERT` three new concerts
- `GET` all concerts
- `DELETE` a specific concert

#### Routing

Create the following routes

| Url | Verb | Functionality | Example | 
| ---- | ----- | ---- | -------- |
| `api/concerts/` | GET | Returns all concerts | `GET api/concerts/` |
| `api/concerts/` | POST | Adds a new concert | `POST api/concerts/` |
| `api/concerts/{id}` | GET | Returns concert by `id` | `GET api/concerts/2` |
| `api/concerts/{id}` | PUT | Updates the concert by `id` | `PUT api/concerts/2` |
| `api/concerts/{id}` | DELETE | Deletes the concert by `id` | `DELETE concerts/2` |

#### Query parameters
| Parameter | Description | Data type | Example | 
| ---- | ----- | ---- | -------- |
| `maxPrice` | Get concerts that has a price smaller than `maxPrice` | Number | `/concerts?maxPrice=160` |
| `title` | Get concerts that partially match a title. `Metallic` will match the concert with the title `Metallica in Parken` | String | `api/concerts?title=metallic` |
| `createdAfter` | Get concerts that has been created after the date | Date | `api/concerts?createdAfter=2019-04-05` |
| `band` | Get concerts with a specific band | String | `api/concerts?band=metallica` |


#### Use the api using postman
Using post man insert some concerts, get some concerts using query parameters, delete some concerts and update some concerts
