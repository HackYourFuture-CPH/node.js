# HackYourFuture Node.js - Homework week 3

## Assignment for this week

Based on the [code demonstrated in the class](../classwork), create a server using `express.js` which extends similar functionality for a Contact List scenario, based on the [contact list example used in previous weeks](../../week1/homework/ContactList.js):

 * The folder is setup based on [Marco's node-babel template](https://github.com/pmcalabrese/node-babel). Get it setup using `npm install` and use the convenience scripts in [package.json](./package.json).
 * Add express into the setup and create a server.
 * Create a RESTFul resource for the [ContactList](./src/ContactList.js) class. Make sure you leverage the class methods as much as possible, as a way to validate resources.
 * Finally, see if you can also use a simple JSON file as a mcok backed for your server.
 * For the FS operations, try and use promises to arrange your code flow.
